## UX  
This site is developed for use by an imaginary graphic design company called 3lite Design  
They are looking for a way to take graphic design orders from customers all over the world  
They want to take a request from the customer give them a quote on the spot and then revert back  
to gain agreement on what is required. The site will allow the user to send images they would  
like included or modified to the admin and also allow them to send a message to clarify their needs.  
User stories below will give a clear view of what is required.
